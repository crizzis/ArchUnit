== Introduction

ArchUnit is a free, simple and extensible library for checking the architecture of your Java code. That is, ArchUnit can check
dependencies between packages and classes, layers and slices, check for cyclic dependencies and more. It does so by
analyzing given Java bytecode, importing all classes into a Java code structure.
ArchUnit's main focus is to automatically test architecture and coding rules, using any plain Java unit testing
framework.

=== Module Overview

ArchUnit consists of two production modules

==== Module archunit

This module houses the actual ArchUnit core infrastructure, i.e. the `ClassFileImporter`,
the domain objects, as well as the rule syntax infrastructure.

==== Module archunit-junit

This module contains the infrastructure to use in combination with JUnit 4, in particular
the `ArchUnitRunner` to cache imported classes.
